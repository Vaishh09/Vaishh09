## About Me

I’m a **Computer Science student at Arizona State University**, graduating in **May 2026**, with a strong interest in building **scalable software systems** and applying **machine learning** to real-world problems.

My work sits at the intersection of **full stack engineering, data, and AI** — from designing clean user interfaces and APIs to building reliable data pipelines and developing ML models with practical constraints in mind.

I value clarity in code, thoughtfulness in system design, and building things that are meant to be used — not just demonstrated.

> I like my code clean, my systems scalable, and my matcha strong.
